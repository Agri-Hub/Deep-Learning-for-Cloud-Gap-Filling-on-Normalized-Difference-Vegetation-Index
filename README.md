# Deep-Learning-for-Cloud-Gap-Filling-on-Normalized-Difference-Vegetation-Index-using-Sentinel-Time-Se
Taking into consideration the ability of Deep Learning architectures to track temporal patterns and identify correlations between optical and SAR data, we apply a CNN-RNN based model that exports dense Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of a static 6- day time resolution.
